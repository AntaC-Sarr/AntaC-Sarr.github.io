I currently am a Postdoctoral Scholar at Department of Earth Sciences, University of Oregon (USA). My research focuses on past climate and environment response to Earth surface deformation and changes in Earthâ€™s orbit configuration using paleoclimate modeling.  My interest lies mainly in understanding how changes in atmospheric circulation affect upper ocean dynamics and our interpretation of the proxy record from time period such as the Pleistocene, the late and middle Miocene and the late Cretaceous.
