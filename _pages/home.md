I am a CNRS Research Scientist at [CEREGE](https://www.cerege.fr/en/){:target="_blank"} (France). My research focuses at understanding past changes in ocean and atmospheric circulation using __Earth System Modeling__. To do so I blend __tracers-enabled climate models__ (marine biogeochemistry, isotopes) with any type of proxy records available. 
<p>&nbsp;</p>

Most of my __ongoing projects__ encompass the following themes :

- Neogene (23-3 Ma) ocean-atmosphere dynamics, with emphasis on monsoons, Indian Ocean and/or Intermediate water circulation
- Tracers-enabled climate models for data-model integration 
- (Paleo)Ocean and planktons across timescales

I am also interested at exploring variability and teleconnections especially related to the Indian Ocean at any time scales.

_At the moment, I do not have funding for Master, PhD or Postdoctoral positions but I am happy to discuss and explore external funding opportunities with anyone interested, including MSCA Postdocs_ [fellowship](https://marie-sklodowska-curie-actions.ec.europa.eu/calls/msca-postdoctoral-fellowships-2025){:target="_blank"} _(open to anyone, deadline in September each year)._ _I welcome colleagues with expertise in analytical tools but that wish to explore modeling as much as modelers._ [CEREGE](https://www.cerege.fr/en/){:target="_blank"} _has an extended geochemistry & micropaleontology expertise/infrastructure that is ideal to develop collaborative data-model approaches._

You can also contact me if you aim at applying for tenured positions at [CNRS](https://carrieres.cnrs.fr/en/external-competitions-for-researchers-m-f/){:target="_blank"} or [IRD](https://en.ird.fr/researcher-competitive-recruitement){:target="_blank"} (those are national-scale recruitment process in France) and want to discuss about the process or potential collaborations.
